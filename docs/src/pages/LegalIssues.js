          EcoSonar does not accept unauthorized idea submissions outside of established business relationships. To protect the interests of our current clients and ourselves, we must treat the issue of such submissions with great care. Importantly, without a clear business relationship, EcoSonar cannot and does not treat any such submissions in confidence. Accordingly, please do not communicate unauthorized idea submissions to EcoSonar through this website. Any ideas disclosed to EcoSonar outside a pre-existing and documented confidential business relationship are not confidential and EcoSonar may therefore develop, use and freely disclose or publish similar ideas without compensating you or accounting to you. EcoSonar will make every reasonable effort to return or destroy any unauthorized idea submissions without detailed review of them. However, if a review is necessary in EcoSonar&apos;s sole discretion, it will be with the understanding that EcoSonar assumes no obligation to protect the confidentiality of your idea or compensate you for its disclosure or use. By submitting an idea or other detailed submission to EcoSonar through this website, you agree to be bound by the terms of this stated policy.
