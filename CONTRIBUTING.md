## How To Contribute
First you will need a Github account to be able to commit into the repository.

We have set up a list of issues that are defined in the Github repository.
The issues can concern bug fixes, small updates on functionalities, additional features or reflexions on new functionalities that could be implemented within EcoSonar.
For each issue, you will find a description of it and what are the acceptance criteria before doing a Pull Request.

When you choose to tackle an issue, 
1) Please assign yourself to the issue or leave a comment mentioning you are taking it
2) Create a new branch with the title of your issue. Do not forget to pull upstream changes into your local repository.
3) Implement/fix your feature, comment your code if needed and add/change the documentation.
3) When doing commits to your branch, please follow as much as possible conventional commits https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/. Be careful in your commit messages to describe what the commit does to the code.
5) Once your issue has been implemented, please create a new pull request with the branch previously created and someone from EcoSonar team will have a look at your PR and do a code review.
