# Roadmap by the end of december

1) Recommendation algorithm to resolve your ecodesign best practices:
- prioritize best practices with the highest impact on your scores thanks to our homemade feature importance model
- prioritize easy-to-resolve best practices 
- balanced prioritization between highest impact and easy-to-resolve best practices

2) Integration of EcoCode : https://www.ecocode.io/

3) CI/CD configuration to prevent deploying into production if your score does not meet your expectation.

Stay tuned...
