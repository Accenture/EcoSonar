# Roadmap by the end of november

1) Integration of W3C Validator audit : https://validator.w3.org/

2) Recommendation algorithm to resolve your ecodesign best practices:
- prioritize best practices with the highest impact on your scores thanks to our homemade feature importance model
- prioritize easy-to-resolve best practices 
- balanced prioritization between highest impact and easy-to-resolve best practices

3) Integration of EcoCode : https://www.ecocode.io/

4) CI/CD configuration to prevent deploying into production if your score does not meet your expectation.

Stay tuned...
